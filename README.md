# DsMMO

The purpose of this mod is to reward players for every action they do. You will get experience for several actions and over time get level ups that let you learn new skills, rituals and increase the effect rate and chance of skills and rituals that you have already learned
But be careful. Everytime you die, you loose half of your exp.

## Rituals
Rituals are a way of sacrificing items to build rare structures or performing useful actions.

### Conducting a ritual
* Place all the needed items on the ground (**but don't use stacked items or you will loose them**)
* The don't need to be placed in any specific order or arrangement but there is always a middle piece that needs to be near enough to all the other ingredients.
* When you have layed out all the needed items, **inspect** the middle piece (you may have to **force inspect**. You can set its key command in the settings).

The lore says that all skills and rituals have a 50 percent better chance to be successful during a full moon...
