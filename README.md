# ![DsMMO](./pics/modicon.png)

Inspired by McMMO for Minecraft, the purpose of this mod is to reward players for every action they do and make the game less grindy the longer they play (and survive).
You will get experience for several actions and over time get level-ups that let you learn new skills, rituals and increase the effect rate and chance of skills and rituals that you have already learned.
But be careful. Every time you die, you loose half of your experience.

The lore says that all skills and rituals have a 50 percent better chance to be successful during a full moon...



# Rituals
Rituals are a way of sacrificing items to build rare structures or performing useful actions.

## Conducting a ritual
* Place all the needed items on the ground (**but don't use stacked items or you will loose them**)
* They don't need to be placed in any specific order or arrangement but there is always a middle piece that needs to be near to all the other ingredients.
* When you have laid out all the needed items, **inspect** the middle piece (you may have to **force inspect**. You can set its key command in the settings).


# Skills
Skills give you bonuses when you conduct an action.
The higher your level in the matching DsMMO-action, the higher is your chance and / or effectiveness of the skill.

# User-commands
User-commands are available for all players. To use them they have to **whispered** into the chat.

## ```#dsmmo [action]```
This command spawns a mini-sign at your current position (which will despawn over time). The sign always shows your last used DsMMO-action and if you examine it, you will be shown your current level, experience and learned skills.
If you specify an action, the mini-sign will show the specified action instead of the last used one.

## ```#dsmmo list```
Lists the levels of all your DsMMO-actions

## ```#dsmmo eat [action] [hunger | health | sanity]```
See the skill [Self-cannibalism](#level-3-self-cannibalism)



# Admin-commands
Admin-commands are only available if you have remote access to the server-console.

## ```dsmmo_reset(player_name)```
Resets all DsMMO-actions to level 0 for the specified player.
The target player has to be online for the command to work properly.

## ```dsmmo_set(player_name, action, level)```
Sets the level of a specific DsMMO-action to the specified level for the specified player.
The target player has to be online for the command to work properly.



This is a server-only mod which means no fancy UI but other users don't need to download anything as long as the server-admin has this mod activated
